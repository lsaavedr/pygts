(Sometimes the frequency is once)


This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list for PyGTS, which
is found at http://pygs.sourceforge.net/.  The questions come from
those asked on the pygts-users and pygts-devel mailing lists.

1. Is PyGTS just a plain port/wrapper of GTS?

No.  PyGTS tries to do things in a way that is natural for python -- it 
should /feel/ like a native python package.  There is extra error checking 
so that fault conditions sometimes encountered using GTS give python 
exceptions instead.  Duplicate objects are avoided implicitly with a 
live-objects lookup table (transparent to the programmer).  Great care 
has been taken to make sure that objects can't be accidently deallocated.  
For boolean operations, there are union(), difference(), and 
intersection() methods.  Altogether, the usage should be a simpler, 
as is appropriate for python.
