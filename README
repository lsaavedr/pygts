2. SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION

  PyGTS is a python package used to construct, manipulate, and perform
  computations on triangulated surfaces.  It is a hand-crafted and 
  "pythonic" binding for the GNU Triangulated Surface (GTS) Library.

  PyGTS lives on-line at http://pygts.sourceforge.net/ .

4. BUILD ENVIRONMENT

  PyGTS should, in principle, work with any python distribution with
  version 2.2 or greater, and on any unix-like operating system
  (including linux and Mac OS X).  The possibility for use with
  Windows is unknown.

  PyGTS is known to work with the following python versions and platforms:
 
    python 2.3 - Mac OS X (10.4)
    python 2.5 - Debian Linux (Lenny), Mac OS X (10.4)

  To build PyGTS, you will need to be sure that Python.h is installed.  
  For linux distributions this often requires installing the python-dev 
  or python2.5-dev (or other version, as appropriate) package.

  The setup.py script requires the following utility, which is used
  to locate C header files and libraries:

    pkg-config - http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/  

  The following libraries must be installed:

    gts - http://gts.sourceforge.net/
    glib-2.0 - http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/index.html

  PyGTS has been verified to work with GTS 0.7.6.

  The following python package (and all of its dependencies) is required
  for the display of the examples:

    mayavi2 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Mayavi/3.2.0

  There are reports that at least one earlier version of mayavi2,
  v2.2, does not have the capabilities that PyGTS needs.  Please note
  that this is still a very early release of PyGTS, and if better (or
  alternative) display options become known, they will be used instead 
  (or in parallel).


5. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  Please help by reporting any difficulties you have installing PyGTS
  to the mailing lists found at

    http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=262159

  To upgrade from version 0.2.0 or earlier, first remove any installed
  PyGTS modules (gts.py, _gts.so) from python's site-packages directory.

  Unpack the distribution by entering

    tar -zxvf pygts.XX.XX.XX.tar.gz

  on the command-line.  Replace the XX's with the appropriate version
  numbers.

  To build PyGTS, cd into the distribution's directory and execute the 
  following:

    python setup.py build

  Install the software (as root) by entering:

    python setup.py install

  To test your installation, cd into the test directory and execute:

    python test.py

  You may also want to run the example programs as a further test:

    cd examples
    python tetrahedron.py
    python boolean.py
    python plotgts.py seashell.gts


6. DOCUMENTATION

  The documentation/api is provided in the python module.  To access it,
  type:

    1) "pydoc gts" - under bash to obtain a 'man'-like help file
    2) "pydoc -w gts" - under bash to write the file gts.html
    3) "help(gts)" - at the python prompt, after importing gts

  A pre-compiled gts.html file is given in the doc/ directory.
